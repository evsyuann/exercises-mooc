# Some exercises from course Python Programming MOOC 2023

Here are some of my completed exercises that I would like to share from the course I have finished. 

## Course content

Python Programming MOOC 2023 consists two main parts: Introduction to Programming and an Advanced Course in Programming.

### Part 1

I learned how to work with strings, lists, and dictionaries. I also worked with files, both reading and writing them. I was introduced to Python modules and then created my own modules.

The first part is divided into seven subparts, comprising a total of 201 exercises:

1. Arithmetic operations, Conditional statements
2. Loops
3. Strings, Functions
4. Lists
5. References, Dictionary, Tuple
6. Reading files, Writing files, Handling errors
7. Modules, Creating your own modules

### Part 2

I learned classes and how to work with them. I also gained knowledge in comprehensions, recursion, and generators, and even tried to create a small game using Pygame.

The second part is divided into seven subparts, comprising a total of 151 exercises:

1. Classes and objects, Defining classes, Defining methods
2. Objects as attributes, Encapsulation
3. Class hierarchies, Object oriented programming techniques
4. List comprehensions, Recursion
5. Generators, Functional programming
6. Pygame
7. Game project (in progress)

## Exercises

* Course records
* Falling asteroids

### Course records

In this exercise, I was tasked with developing an interactive application for tracking studies. I had the freedom to choose its structure, and I chose to use classes for a more convenient and organized approach.

### Falling asteroids

I created a small game in which a robot's purpose is to collect asteroids, and when it misses one, the game automatically restarts.
